        <p class="p1"><strong>JavaScript</strong> is a high-level programming language commonly used to add interactivity and dynamics to web pages. Key features of JavaScript include:</p>
        <p class="p1"><strong>Client-Side:</strong> JavaScript runs on the client side (in user's web browsers), allowing it to respond to user actions and dynamically modify the page's display in real-time.</p>
        <p class="p1"><strong>Asynchronous:</strong> JavaScript supports asynchronous execution, enabling the performance of long-running operations (e.g., data retrieval from servers) without blocking the user interface.</p>
        <p class="p1"><strong>DOM Manipulation:</strong> JavaScript allows manipulation of the Document Object Model (DOM), meaning it can add, modify, and delete elements on a web page, dynamically altering its content and appearance.</p>
        <p class="p1"><strong>Easy to Learn:</strong> JavaScript is relatively easy to learn and is used for rapid prototyping and development. Its syntax is similar to other programming languages like Java and C++.</p>
        <p class="p1"><strong>Wide Application:</strong> JavaScript is not limited to web development. It can be used for mobile app development (e.g., through frameworks like React Native), working with IoT devices, and much more.</p>

        <h1 class="h1">About the Python Programming Language</h1>
        <p class="p1">Python is a high-level programming language known for its simple and readable syntax. It is renowned for making code development and understanding easy, making it a popular choice for both beginners and experienced programmers.</p>
        <h2 class="h2">Key Information about Python:</h2>
        <p class="p1"><strong class="p2">1. Simple and Readable Syntax:</strong> Python stands out with its simple and readable syntax, making it an excellent choice for programming beginners. It's often said that Python is "like the English language," meaning it is easy to understand even for non-programmers.</p>
        <p class="p1"><strong class="p2">2. High-Level Programming Language:</strong> Python is a high-level programming language, which means it abstracts away low-level hardware details. This makes it very suitable for rapid application development and prototyping.</p>
        <p class="p1"><strong class="p2">3. Large Community and Support:</strong> Python has a large and active community of developers worldwide. This means there is a wealth of resources, libraries, and frameworks to assist in developing applications for various purposes, including web development, scientific computing, machine learning, and more.</p>
        <img class="img1" src="slike/python2.jpg">
        <p class="p1"><strong class="p2">4. Universality:</strong> Python is used in various domains, including web development (Python web frameworks like Django and Flask), scientific computing (NumPy, pandas), data analysis (Pandas, Matplotlib), machine learning (TensorFlow, PyTorch), and task automation.</p>
        <p class="p1"><strong class="p2">5. Open Source:</strong> Python is an open-source language, meaning it is free to use and has open-source code. This encourages development and innovation within the community.</p>
        <p class="p1"><strong class="p2">6. Platform-Independent:</strong> Python is a platform-independent language, which means it can run on different operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.</p>
        <img class="img2" src="slike/python.png">
        <p class="p1"><strong class="p2">7. Interpreted Language:</strong> Python is an interpreted language, meaning it is executed line by line by the Python interpreter. This makes testing and rapid development easier.</p>
        <p class="p1"><strong class="p2">8. Dynamic Typing:</strong> Python is a dynamically typed language, meaning you don't need to declare variable types in advance. The interpreter automatically determines the variable type based on assigned values.</p>
        <p class="p1"><strong class="p2">9. Abundance of Learning Resources:</strong> If you want to learn Python, there are many online courses, tutorials, books, and video materials available to help you. Python is an excellent choice for those who want to learn programming.</p>
        <p class="p3">I hope you have gained a better understanding of the Python programming language and its key characteristics. Python is not just another programming language; it's a tool that simplifies development and enables innovation in various fields, from web development to scientific research and artificial intelligence.</p>
